# Coding Standards
- Implement only the agreed plan and architecture; request approval before altering scope or design.
- Conform to existing code style; if absent, apply language-appropriate formatter consistently.
- Keep functions small and purposeful; remove unused code and dead branches.
- Document non-obvious logic with concise comments; avoid redundant narration.
- Maintain deterministic behavior; avoid hidden state and unnecessary global mutations.
- Validate inputs and handle expected error cases; fail safely with clear messages.
