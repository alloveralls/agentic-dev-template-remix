# Testing Policy
- Provide automated tests for new functionality and for fixes to regressions.
- Update existing tests when behavior changes to reflect the approved plan and architecture.
- Run the relevant test suites before completion; report commands and outcomes.
- Do not ship changes with failing or unexecuted required tests unless explicitly waived by the human.
- Prefer deterministic, isolated tests that avoid external dependencies without approval.
