name: architecture
description: Define system design, interfaces, and data flow consistent with the approved plan and policies.
---

## Purpose
Create an architecture outline with components, responsibilities, interfaces, data flows, and decision notes ready for review.

## Inputs
- Approved plan and goals
- Constraints and applicable policies
- Existing system context and boundaries

## Steps
1. Confirm scope, constraints, and non-functional requirements.
2. Identify components, responsibilities, and interfaces.
3. Describe data flow, integrations, and edge cases.
4. Capture decisions, trade-offs, and open questions for review.

## Outputs
- Architecture outline with components, interfaces, data flows, and decision notes.

## Failure modes
- Introducing new scope or features
- Omitting constraints, edge cases, or policy alignment
- Providing implementation details instead of architectural guidance
