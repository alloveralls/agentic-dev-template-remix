description: Break down objectives into sequenced tasks, dependencies, and milestones aligned with policies and constraints.

## Purpose
Produce an ordered plan with tasks, dependencies, owners, and success criteria for approval.

## Inputs
- Goals and scope approved by the human
- Constraints and applicable policies
- Current context (progress, architecture, risks)

## Steps
1. Confirm goals, constraints, and required policies.
2. Enumerate tasks with clear owners, prerequisites, and dependencies.
3. Order tasks into a minimal, testable sequence; flag risks and assumptions.
4. Present the plan succinctly for approval before execution.

## Outputs
- An ordered plan with tasks, dependencies, owners, and success criteria.

## Failure modes
- Missing constraints or policies
- Overly detailed or implementation-specific steps
- Scope creep or unapproved expansion
